## Features:

1) As a User I would like to search github in order to view the available repositories for a given search term

    2a. URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc

3) As a User I would like to link off to the actual GitHub page where the repository is located in order to view the code in the repository

4) As a User I would like to view a list of all the current issues for a repository in order to view the backlog of issues

5) As a User I would like to filter the list of issues between STATE = [“Open” or “Closed”] in order to look through the filtered list

6) As a User I would like to view a PIE chart that displays the breakdown of issues for the repository (open vs closed) in order to visually see how well built and maintained the repository is
